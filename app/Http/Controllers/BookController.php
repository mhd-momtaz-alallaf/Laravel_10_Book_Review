            1-Accessing as Property "$book->reviews" (Without Parentheses):
              When you access a relationship as a property, Laravel automatically executes the relationship query and returns the result.
              For example, $book->reviews would execute the relationship query and return the reviews related to the book.

            2-Accessing as Method "$book->reviews()" (With Parentheses):
              When you access a relationship as a method (by adding parentheses), it returns a Query Builder instance for the relationship.
              This allows you to further refine the query or apply additional constraints before executing it. 
              For example, $book->reviews() would return a Query Builder instance for the reviews relationship, 
              allowing you to chain methods like where, orderBy, or paginate.
